# csgoshit
csgoshit is a little linux hack for csgo (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive).
Features: bhop, wallhack(chams), triggerbot.

## Startup
*As for now, can't test if it work, but steps to startup sholud be the same as
for [hlhax](https://github.com/UnkwUsr/hlhax), except cloning half-life 1 sdk*

## Motivation
Originally it was written because I very love bhop, but my mouse wheel gets
broken too fast. So I decided to write this hack. Later, as I already have
base, I tried to add some features, like wallhack(chams) and triggerbot.

## Credits
Thanks to [aimtux](https://github.com/AimTuxOfficial/AimTux) project for
~~sdk~~ ~~base~~ everything (this is 99% copy-pasta with trimmed things I
thought "don't need").
